### Anaysis code of Lee et al. 2025
#### These codes were developed to detect eye blinks or eye movements based on coordinate information written in an Excel file, obtained using DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018, Nature Neuroscience) to detect the upper lid, lower lid, or pupil position of the mouse eye.
### Environment: Window 10, MATLAB 2020b
### For eye blink test, execute the functions specified in 'run_this_eye_blink.m' one by one.
### For VOR test, execute the functions specified in 'run_this_vor.m' one by one.
